## Project Overview ##

The php-govtalk project is a PHP client library designed to assist in developing web-based applications which interface with the UKâ€™s Government Gateway through the use of the standard message envelope.

The GovTalk Message Envelope is a standard developed by the United Kingdom government as a means of encapsulating a range of government XML services in a single standard data format.
